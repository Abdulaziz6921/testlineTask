Project Overview

This project is a web-based quiz application built using React.js with Vite as the build tool and Tailwind CSS for styling. The application fetches quiz data from a provided API endpoint and displays it in an interactive and engaging user interface. If the API fails, the application gracefully falls back to mock data to ensure a seamless user experience.

Technologies Used

React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Vite: A fast build tool for modern web development.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

Axios: For making HTTP requests to fetch quiz data.

Error Handling:

If the API fails to fetch data, the application automatically switches to mock data to ensure uninterrupted functionality.
